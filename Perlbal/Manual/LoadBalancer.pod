=head1 Using Perlbal as a Load Balancer

Configuring Perlbal as a Load Balancer.


=head2 VERSION

This document details load balancing configuration of Perlbal 1.76.


=head2 Configuring Perlbal as a Load Balancer

By default, perlbal looks for a configuration file at /etc/perlbal/perlbal.conf.

You can also point perlbal at a different configuration file with the -c flag.

    $ perlbal -c /home/user/perlbal.conf


=head3 Simple load balancing 

Let's assume you want to configure two machines to serve your website and you want to let Perlbal decide how to balance the requests. For sake of this exercise let's assume you have two servers serving at:

    10.0.0.1:80
    10.0.0.2:80

And now you want to use these two machines to serve your website at:

    10.0.0.3:80


Here's a sample configuration to make this happen:

    CREATE POOL mywebsite
        POOL mywebsite ADD 10.0.0.1:80
        POOL mywebsite ADD 10.0.0.2:80

    CREATE SERVICE service_mywebsite
        SET role            = reverse_proxy
        SET pool            = mywebsite
        SET listen          = 10.0.0.3:80
    ENABLE service_mywebsite


The first line defines a pool of machines called C<mywebsite>. The second and third lines add your two machines to that pool (note that the indentation is not mandatory).

After that you define a service called C<service_mywebsite> set to listen on C<10.0.0.3:80> and using the pool C<mywebsite> to serve the requests. The role is indeed C<reverse_proxy>, as the architecture used is the same both for setting up Perlbal as a Load Balancer and as a Reverse Proxy (for more information on this see section C<Load Balancer vs. Reverse Proxy> of this document).

The last line is what allows you have several services configured in a file even if they are not currently active (a common scenario is to configure everything on the file and then enable/disable services on-the-fly as required; see C<Perlbal::Manual::Management> for more information on this process).


=head3 High priority queuing system

...


Sometimes if the high priority queue is really busy, the standard queue will suffer from resource starvation. The queue relief system helps prevent this. When there are C<queue_relief_size> or more connections in the standard queue, newly available backends have a C<queue_relief_chance> percent chance of
taking a request from the standard priority queue instead of the high priority queue.

    SET web_proxy.queue_relief_size = 2000
    SET web_proxy.queue_relief_chance = 30 # 0-100, in percent


=head2 Fail Over

Whenever Perlbal fails to open a connection to a machine, it assumes that machine is not available and spreads the load between the remaining servers. It keeps trying to open connections to that server according to C<error_retry_schedule>.

If there are no available servers, Perlbal will keep trying to open connections to the servers until C<idle_timeout> is reached, upon which it will close the connection to the user. Clients interpret that closing differently: most will assume a 500 HTTP code, a few assume a 200 OK with empty content.

For more information on parameters C<idle_timeout> and C<error_retry_schedule> see C<Perlbal::Manual::ReverseProxy>.


=head2 Parameters

You can set parameters via commands of either forms:

    SET <service-name> <param> = <value>
    SET <param> = <value>

For a full list of parameters see C<Perlbal::Manual::ReverseProxy>.


=head2 Load Balancer vs. Reverse Proxy

A Load Balancer and a Reverse Proxy can often be the same thing; not always, but often.

A Load Balancer is a server (or device) that balances requests across a number of servers to spread the load. A Reverse Proxy can still do this but still have a number of other features:

=over 4

=item cache

A reverse proxy can cache static content from your servers and serve it directly in order to reduce the load on your machines

=item security

Think of a reverse proxy as something that stands in the way between the users and your servers; this reverse proxy can add an extra layer of protection to your servers

=item etc.

=back

You could almost say that a Load Balancer is a subset of a Reverse Proxy (it's not, but you could).

When it comes to C<Perlbal>, the Load Balancer is implemented as a Reverse Proxy without all the extra options, and that's why you set the role of a Load Balancer to C<reverse_proxy>:

    SET role            = reverse_proxy
