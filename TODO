general:
    [ ] check perlbal's repository to ensure we're working with upcoming changes

on perlbal.pod:
    [ ] write the section Troubleshooting
    [x]    dependencies that need to be compiled and there's no compiler available
    [x] installing Perlbal by hand
    [ ]    decide whether we want to keep this section
    [x] installing Perlbal on a machine that's not connected to the internet (CPAN dependencies trouble)
    [ ] installing Perlbal on systems that have packages for it
