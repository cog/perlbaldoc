general:

on Perlbal::Manual::Install:
    [x] write the section Troubleshooting
    [x]    dependencies that need to be compiled and there's no compiler available
    [x] installing Perlbal by hand
    [x]    decide whether we want to keep this section - YES
    [x] installing Perlbal on a machine that's not connected to the internet (CPAN dependencies trouble)
    [ ] how to test Perlbal (to see if everything went as expected)
    [x] how to install Perlbal's latest release (from github)

    [x]    what if the last machine failed; what happens underneath?
    [x]    how does the system recover?
