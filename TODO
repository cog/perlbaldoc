general:
    [ ] check perlbal's repository to ensure we're working with upcoming changes

on Perlbal::Manual::Install:
    [ ] write the section Troubleshooting

    [x] installing Perlbal by hand
    [ ]    decide whether we want to keep this section
    [x] installing Perlbal on a machine that's not connected to the internet (CPAN dependencies trouble)
    [ ] installing Perlbal on systems that have packages for it
    [ ] how to test Perlbal (to see if everything went as expected)
