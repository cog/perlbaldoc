=head1 NAME

Perlbal::Manual::FailOver - Fail Over mechanism in Perlbal


=head2 VERSION

Perlbal 1.76.


=head2 DESCRIPTION

How Perlbal's Fail Over mechanism works.


=head2 Fail Over

Whenever Perlbal fails to open a connection to a machine, it assumes that machine is not available and spreads the load between the remaining servers. It keeps trying to open connections to that server according to C<error_retry_schedule>.

If there are no available servers, Perlbal will keep trying to open connections to the servers until C<idle_timeout> is reached, upon which it will close the connection to the user. Clients interpret that closing differently: most will assume a 500 HTTP code, a few assume a 200 OK with empty content.

For more information on parameters C<idle_timeout> and C<error_retry_schedule> see L<Perlbal::Manual::ReverseProxy>.
