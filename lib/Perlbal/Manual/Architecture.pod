Perlbal::Manual::Architecture - Perlbal's architecture at a glance


=head2 Classes

The following is a brief introduction/overview to all of Perlbal's classes:


=head3 Perlbal::Socket

Descends from Danga::Socket.

Adds on to the base class to provide some functionality specifically useful for creating HTTP sockets.

Perlbal::Socket has the following fields:

=over 4

=item headers_string

Headers as they're being read.


=item req_headers

The final Perlbal::HTTPHeaders object inbound.


=item res_headers

Response headers outbound (Perlbal::HTTPHeaders object).


=item create_time

Creation time.


=item alive_time

Last time noted alive.


=item state

General purpose state; used by descendants.


=item do_die

If on, die and do no further requests.


=item read_buf

Arrayref of scalarref read from client.


=item read_ahead

Bytes sitting in read_buf.


=item read_size

Total bytes read from client, ever.

=item ditch_leading_rn

If true, the next header parsing will ignore a leading \r\n.


=item observed_ip_string

If defined, contains the observed IP string of the peer we're serving. This is intended for holding the value of the X-Forwarded-For and using it to govern ACLs.


=back


=head3 Perlbal::TCPListener

Descends from Perlbal::Socket.

Very lightweight and fast connection accept class. Takes incoming connections as fast as possible and passes them off, instantiating one of the various Client* classes to handle it.

Perlbal::TCPListener has the following fields:

=over 4

=item ...

...


=back


=head3 Perlbal::BackendHTTP

Descends from Perlbal::Socket.

This class handles connections to the backend web nodes for getting data back to the user. This class is used by other classes such as ClientProxy to send a request to an internal node.

Perlbal::BackendHTTP has the following fields:

=over 4

=item ...

...


=head3 Perlbal::HTTPHeaders

Header management. Parses headers (request and response) and stores data for further user. Also manages validation of the request line so that it conforms to HTTP specifications.

Perlbal::HTTPHeaders has the following fields:

=over 4

=item ...

...


=head3 Perlbal::ClientHTTPBase

Descends from Perlbal::Socket.

Provides base functionality to ClientHTTP and ClientProxy. Notably, the ability to efficiently send files to the remote user. Also handles most of the state logic for statistics and such. Is also used for services of type C<selector>. The ClientHTTPBase then reads in the request headers, and asks the service to re-bless the client instance to a more specific type, for either a ClientProxy or ClientHTTP (depending on selector's mapping).

Perlbal::ClientHTTPBase has the following fields:

=over 4

=item ...

...


=head3 Perlbal::ClientHTTP

Descends from Perlbal::ClientHTTPBase.

Very simple and lightweight class. Handles sending files to the user without much overhead. Most of the functionality is contained in the parent class, and this class doesn't implement much new stuff.

Perlbal::ClientHTTP has the following fields:

=over 4

=item ...

...


=head3 Perlbal::ClientProxy

Descends from Perlbal::ClientHTTPBase.

Takes an incoming connection from a user and connects to a backend node (C<BackendHTTP>) and relays the request. The backend can then either tell the proxy to reproxy and load a file from disk, or return a file directly, or just return a status message.

Perlbal::ClientProxy has the following fields:

=over 4

=item ...

...


=head3 Perlbal::ClientManage

Descends from Perlbal::Socket.

Simple interface that provides a way for users to use the management interface of Perlbal. You can connect to the management port (as defined in the config file) with a web browser or regular telnet (see C<Perlbal::Manual::Management> for more information on this).

Perlbal::ClientManage has the following fields:

=over 4

=item ...

...


=head3 Perlbal::Service

A service is a particular item that Perlbal is doing. Services can have a role which defines how they behave. Each service can also have a bunch of parameters set to further adjust its behavior. By itself, the Service class handles maintaining pools of backend connections and managing statistics about itself.

Perlbal::Service has the following fields:

=over 4

=item ...

...


=head3 Perlbal::StatsListener

Descends from Perlbal::Socket.

This class listens for UDP broadcasts from the web nodes describing how many available children they have. This information is then used to pick an endpoint for a backend connection to be made to in order to handle a user's incoming request.

                            {{ INTERNET }}
                                  |
                                  v
              [Service]<===>[TCPListener]
                          ___/    |    \___
                         v        v        v
             [ClientManage]  [ClientHTTP] [ClientProxy]
                                                ^
                                                |
                                                v
                                          [BackendHTTP]

So connections come in from wherever and get to the TCPListener. It uses Service objects to determine what kind of Client* to spawn. The Client classes then handle crafting the response for the user.

Perlbal::StatsListener has the following fields:

=over 4

=item ...
